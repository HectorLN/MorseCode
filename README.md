# MorseCode

Morse code project for automata theory 2 class

The project itself is a morse code translator in C#. It pulls the console and a menu comes up with 3 options:
- Tranlate text to morse code
- Translate morse code to text
- Exit

Inside the first 2 options there is a sub-menu after completing a translation. The console will ask you if you want to keep translating; yes answer allows you to enter another text; no answer will close the program.
